description: 'In this tutorial, we will implement and discuss variants of modern CNN
  architectures.

  There have been many different architectures been proposed over the past few years.

  Some of the most impactful ones, and still relevant today, are the following: [GoogleNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842)/Inception
  architecture (winner of ILSVRC 2014), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
  (winner of ILSVRC 2015), and [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) (best
  paper award CVPR 2017).

  All of them were state-of-the-art models when being proposed, and the core ideas
  of these networks are the foundations for most current state-of-the-art architectures.

  Thus, it is important to understand these architectures in detail and learn how
  to implement them.

  This notebook is part of a lecture series on Deep Learning at the University of
  Amsterdam.
