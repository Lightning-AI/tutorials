description: 'In this tutorial, we will look at energy-based deep learning models,
  and focus on their application as generative models.

  Energy models have been a popular tool before the huge deep learning hype around
  2012 hit.

  However, in recent years, energy-based models have gained increasing attention because
  of improved training methods and tricks being proposed.

  Although they are still in a research stage, they have shown to outperform strong
  Generative Adversarial Networks

  in certain cases which have been the state of the art of generating images

  ([blog post](https://ajolicoeur.wordpress.com/the-new-contender-to-gans-score-matching-with-langevin-sampling/)about
  strong energy-based models,

  [blog post](https://medium.com/syncedreview/nvidia-open-sources-hyper-realistic-face-generator-stylegan-f346e1a73826)
  about the power of GANs).

  Hence, it is important to be aware of energy-based models, and as the theory can
  be abstract sometimes,

  we will show the idea of energy-based models with a lot of examples.

  This notebook is part of a lecture series on Deep Learning at the University of
  Amsterdam.
