description: 'In this tutorial, we will review techniques for optimization and initialization
  of neural networks.

  When increasing the depth of neural networks, there are various challenges we face.

  Most importantly, we need to have a stable gradient flow through the network, as
  otherwise, we might encounter vanishing or exploding gradients.

  This is why we will take a closer look at the following concepts: initialization
  and optimization.

  This notebook is part of a lecture series on Deep Learning at the University of
  Amsterdam.
