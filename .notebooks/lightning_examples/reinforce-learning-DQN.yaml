description: 'Main takeaways:


  1. RL has the same flow as previous models we have seen, with a few additions

  2. Handle unsupervised learning by using an IterableDataset where the dataset itself

  3. Each training step carries has the agent taking an action in the environment
  and storing the experience in the IterableDataset
