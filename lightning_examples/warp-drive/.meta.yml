description: This notebook introduces multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with WarpDrive (Lan et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13976).
  WarpDrive is a flexible, lightweight, and easy-to-use open-source framework that implements end-to-end deep MARL on GPUs.
  WarpDrive enables orders-of-magnitude speedups compared to CPU-GPU implementations, using the parallelization capability
  of GPUs and several design choices to minimize communication overhead. WarpDrive also prioritizes user-friendliness -
  it has utility functions to easily build MARL environments in CUDA and quality-of-life tools to run end-to-end MARL
  using just a few lines of code, and is compatible with PyTorch.

  WarpDrive includes the following resources.
    code - https://github.com/salesforce/warp-drive
    documentation - http://opensource.salesforce.com/warp-drive/, and
    white paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13976.
