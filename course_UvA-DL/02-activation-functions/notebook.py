# ## Common activation functions

# %% [markdown]
# As a first step, we will implement some common activation functions by ourselves.
# Of course, most of them can also be found in the `torch.nn` package (see the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#non-linear-activations-weighted-sum-nonlinearity) for an overview).
# However, we'll write our own functions here for a better understanding and insights.
#
# For an easier time of comparing various activation functions, we start
# with defining a base class from which all our future modules will
# inherit:


# %%
class ActivationFunction(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = self.__class__.__name__
        self.config = {"name": self.name}


# %% [markdown]
# Every activation function will be an `nn.Module` so that we can integrate them nicely in a network.
# We will use the `config` dictionary to store adjustable parameters for some activation functions.
#
# Next, we implement two of the "oldest" activation functions that are still commonly used for various tasks: sigmoid and tanh.
# Both the sigmoid and tanh activation can be also found as PyTorch functions (`torch.sigmoid`, `torch.tanh`) or as modules (`nn.Sigmoid`, `nn.Tanh`).
# Here, we implement them by hand:


# %%
class Sigmoid(ActivationFunction):
    def forward(self, x):
        return 1 / (1 + torch.exp(-x))


class Tanh(ActivationFunction):
    def forward(self, x):
        x_exp, neg_x_exp = torch.exp(x), torch.exp(-x)
        return (x_exp - neg_x_exp) / (x_exp + neg_x_exp)


# %% [markdown]
# Another popular activation function that has allowed the training of deeper networks, is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).
# Despite its simplicity of being a piecewise linear function, ReLU has one major benefit compared to sigmoid and tanh: a strong, stable gradient for a large range of values.
# Based on this idea, a lot of variations of ReLU have been proposed, of which we will implement the following three: LeakyReLU, ELU, and Swish.
# LeakyReLU replaces the zero settings in the negative part with a smaller slope to allow gradients to flow also in this part of the input.
# Similarly, ELU replaces the negative part with an exponential decay.
# The third, most recently proposed activation function is Swish, which is actually the result of a large experiment with the purpose of finding the "optimal" activation function.
# Compared to the other activation functions, Swish is both smooth and non-monotonic (i.e. contains a change of sign in the gradient).
# This has been shown to prevent dead neurons as in standard ReLU activation, especially for deep networks.
# If interested, a more detailed discussion of the benefits of Swish can be found in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941) [1].
#
# Let's implement the four activation functions below:


# %%
class ReLU(ActivationFunction):
    def forward(self, x):
        return x * (x > 0).float()


class LeakyReLU(ActivationFunction):
    def __init__(self, alpha=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.config["alpha"] = alpha

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.where(x > 0, x, self.config["alpha"] * x)


class ELU(ActivationFunction):
    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.where(x > 0, x, torch.exp(x) - 1)


class Swish(ActivationFunction):
    def forward(self, x):
        return x * torch.sigmoid(x)


# %% [markdown]
# For later usage, we summarize all our activation functions in a dictionary mapping the name to the class object.
# In case you implement a new activation function by yourself, add it here to include it in future comparisons as well:

# %%
act_fn_by_name = {"sigmoid": Sigmoid, "tanh": Tanh, "relu": ReLU, "leakyrelu": LeakyReLU, "elu": ELU, "swish": Swish}

# %% [markdown]
# ### Visualizing activation functions
#
# To get an idea of what each activation function actually does, we will visualize them in the following.
# Next to the actual activation value, the gradient of the function is an important aspect as it is crucial for optimizing the neural network.
# PyTorch allows us to compute the gradients simply by calling the `backward` function:


# %%
def get_grads(act_fn, x):
    """Computes the gradients of an activation function at specified positions.

    Args:
        act_fn: An object of the class "ActivationFunction" with an implemented forward pass.
        x: 1D input tensor.

    Returns:
        A tensor with the same size of x containing the gradients of act_fn at x.

    """
    x = x.clone().requires_grad_()  # Mark the input as tensor for which we want to store gradients
    out = act_fn(x)
    out.sum().backward()  # Summing results in an equal gradient flow to each element in x
    return x.grad  # Accessing the gradients of x by "x.grad"


# %% [markdown]
# Now we can visualize all our activation functions including their gradients:


# %%
def vis_act_fn(act_fn, ax, x):
    # Run activation function
    y = act_fn(x)
    y_grads = get_grads(act_fn, x)
    # Push x, y and gradients back to cpu for plotting
    x, y, y_grads = x.cpu().numpy(), y.cpu().numpy(), y_grads.cpu().numpy()

    ax.set_title(act_fn.name)
    ax.legend()
    ax.set_ylim(-1.5, x.max())


# Add activation functions if wanted
act_fns = [act_fn() for act_fn in act_fn_by_name.values()]
x = torch.linspace(-5, 5, 1000)  # Range on which we want to visualize the activation functions

cols = 2
rows = math.ceil(len(act_fns) / float(cols))

# ### Visualizing the gradient flow after initialization
#
# As mentioned previously, one important aspect of activation functions is how they propagate gradients through the network.
# Imagine we have a very deep neural network with more than 50 layers.
# The gradients for the input layer, i.e. the very first layer, have passed >50 times the activation function, but we still want them to be of a reasonable size.
# If the gradient through the activation function is (in expectation) considerably smaller than 1, our gradients will vanish until they reach the input layer.
# If the gradient through the activation function is larger than 1, the gradients exponentially increase and might explode.
#
# To get a feeling of how every activation function influences the
# gradients, we can look at a freshly initialized network and measure the
# gradients for each parameter for a batch of 256 images:


# %%

# The sigmoid activation function shows a clearly undesirable behavior.
# While the gradients for the output layer are very large with up to 0.1, the input layer has the lowest gradient norm across all activation functions with only 1e-5.
# This is due to its small maximum gradient of 1/4, and finding a suitable learning rate across all layers is not possible in this setup.
# All the other activation functions show to have similar gradient norms across all layers.
# Interestingly, the ReLU activation has a spike around 0 which is caused by its zero-part on the left, and dead neurons (we will take a closer look at this later on).
#
# Note that additionally to the activation, the initialization of the weight parameters can be crucial.
# By default, PyTorch uses the [Kaiming](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html#torch.nn.init.kaiming_uniform_) initialization for linear layers optimized for Tanh activations.
# In Tutorial 4, we will take a closer look at initialization, but assume
# for now that the Kaiming initialization works for all activation

# Not surprisingly, the model using the sigmoid activation function shows to fail and does not improve upon random performance (10 classes => 1/10 for random chance).

# All the other activation functions gain similar performance.
# To have a more accurate conclusion, we would have to train the models for multiple seeds and look at the averages.

# As the model with sigmoid activation was not able to train properly, the activations are also less informative and all gathered around 0.5 (the activation at input 0).
#
# The tanh shows a more diverse behavior.
# While for the input layer we experience a larger amount of neurons to be close to -1 and 1, where the gradients are close to zero, the activations in the two consecutive layers are closer to zero.
# This is probably because the input layers look for specific features in the input image, and the consecutive layers combine those together.
# The activations for the last layer are again more biased to the extreme points because the classification layer can be seen as a weighted average of those values (the gradients push the activations to those extremes).
#
# The ReLU has a strong peak at 0, as we initially expected.
# The effect of having no gradients for negative values is that the network does not have a Gaussian-like distribution after the linear layers, but a longer tail towards the positive values.
# The LeakyReLU shows a very similar behavior while ELU follows again a more Gaussian-like distribution.
# The Swish activation seems to lie in between, although it is worth noting that Swish uses significantly higher values than other activation functions (up to 20).
#
# As all activation functions show slightly different behavior although
# obtaining similar performance for our simple network, it becomes
# apparent that the selection of the "optimal" activation function really
# depends on many factors, and is not the same for all possible networks.

# ### Finding dead neurons in ReLU networks

# %% [markdown]
# One known drawback of the ReLU activation is the occurrence of "dead neurons", i.e. neurons with no gradient for any training input.
# The issue of dead neurons is that as no gradient is provided for the layer, we cannot train the parameters of this neuron in the previous layer to obtain output values besides zero.
# For dead neurons to happen, the output value of a specific neuron of the linear layer before the ReLU has to be negative for all input images.
# Considering the large number of neurons we have in a neural network, it is not unlikely for this to happen.
#
# To get a better understanding of how much of a problem this is, and when we need to be careful, we will measure how many dead neurons different networks have.
# For this, we implement a function which runs the network on the whole
# training set and records whether a neuron is exactly 0 for all data
# points or not:


# %%
@torch.no_grad()
def measure_number_dead_neurons(net):
    """Function to measure the number of dead neurons in a trained neural network.

    For each neuron, we create a boolean variable initially set to 1. If it has an activation unequals 0 at any time, we

# %% [markdown]
# First, we can measure the number of dead neurons for an untrained network:

# %%
set_seed(42)
net_relu = BaseNetwork(act_fn=ReLU()).to(device)
measure_number_dead_neurons(net_relu)

# %% [markdown]
# We see that only a minor amount of neurons are dead, but that they increase with the depth of the layer.
# However, this is not a problem for the small number of dead neurons we have as the input to later layers is changed due to updates to the weights of previous layers.
# Therefore, dead neurons in later layers can potentially become "alive"/active again.
#
# How does this look like for a trained network (with the same initialization)?

# %%
net_relu = load_model(model_path=CHECKPOINT_PATH, model_name="FashionMNIST_relu").to(device)
measure_number_dead_neurons(net_relu)

# %% [markdown]
# The number of dead neurons indeed decreased in the later layers.
# However, it should be noted that dead neurons are especially problematic in the input layer.
# As the input does not change over epochs (the training set is kept as it is), training the network cannot turn those neurons back active.
# Still, the input data has usually a sufficiently high standard deviation to reduce the risk of dead neurons.
#
# Finally, we check how the number of dead neurons behaves with increasing layer depth.
# For instance, let's take the following 10-layer neural network:

# %%
set_seed(42)
net_relu = BaseNetwork(
    act_fn=ReLU(),
    hidden_sizes=[256, 256, 256, 256, 256, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128],
).to(device)
measure_number_dead_neurons(net_relu)

# %% [markdown]
# The number of dead neurons is significantly higher than before which harms the gradient flow especially in the first iterations.
# For instance, more than 56% of the neurons in the pre-last layer are dead which creates a considerable bottleneck.
# Hence, it is advisible to use other nonlinearities like Swish for very deep networks.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Conclusion
#
# In this notebook, we have reviewed a set of six activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, LeakyReLU, ELU, and Swish) in neural networks, and discussed how they influence the gradient distribution across layers.
# Sigmoid tends to fail deep neural networks as the highest gradient it provides is 0.25 leading to vanishing gradients in early layers.
# All ReLU-based activation functions have shown to perform well, and besides the original ReLU, do not have the issue of dead neurons.
# When implementing your own neural network, it is recommended to start
# with a ReLU-based network and select the specific activation function
# based on the properties of the network.
