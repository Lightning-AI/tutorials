# ## Preparation

# %% [markdown]
# Throughout this notebook, we will use a deep fully connected network, similar to our previous tutorial.
# We will also again apply the network to FashionMNIST, so you can relate to the results of Tutorial 3.
# We start by loading the FashionMNIST dataset:

# %%

# Transformations applied on each image => first make them a tensor, then normalize them with mean 0 and std 1
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.2861,), (0.3530,))])

# Loading the training dataset. We need to split it into a training and validation part
train_dataset = FashionMNIST(root=DATASET_PATH, train=True, transform=transform, download=True)
train_set, val_set = torch.utils.data.random_split(train_dataset, [50000, 10000])

# Loading the test set
test_set = FashionMNIST(root=DATASET_PATH, train=False, transform=transform, download=True)

# %% [markdown]
# We define a set of data loaders that we can use for various purposes later.
# Note that for actually training a model, we will use different data loaders
# with a lower batch size.

# %%
train_loader = data.DataLoader(train_set, batch_size=1024, shuffle=True, drop_last=False)
val_loader = data.DataLoader(val_set, batch_size=1024, shuffle=False, drop_last=False)
test_loader = data.DataLoader(test_set, batch_size=1024, shuffle=False, drop_last=False)

# %% [markdown]
# In comparison to the previous tutorial, we have changed the parameters of the normalization transformation `transforms.Normalize`.
# The normalization is now designed to give us an expected mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 across pixels.
# This will be particularly relevant for the discussion about initialization we will look at below, and hence we change it here.
# It should be noted that in most classification tasks, both normalization techniques (between -1 and 1 or mean 0 and stddev 1) have shown to work well.
# We can calculate the normalization parameters by determining the mean and standard deviation on the original images:

# %%
print("Mean", (train_dataset.data.float() / 255.0).mean().item())
print("Std", (train_dataset.data.float() / 255.0).std().item())

# %% [markdown]
# We can verify the transformation by looking at the statistics of a single batch:

# %%
imgs, _ = next(iter(train_loader))
print(f"Mean: {imgs.mean().item():5.3f}")
print(f"Standard deviation: {imgs.std().item():5.3f}")
print(f"Maximum: {imgs.max().item():5.3f}")
print(f"Minimum: {imgs.min().item():5.3f}")

# %% [markdown]
# Note that the maximum and minimum are not 1 and -1 anymore, but shifted towards the positive values.
# This is because FashionMNIST contains a lot of black pixels, similar to MNIST.
#
# Next, we create a linear neural network. We use the same setup as in the previous tutorial.


# %%

# ## Initialization
#
# Before starting our discussion about initialization, it should be noted that there exist many very good blog posts about the topic of neural network initialization (for example [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/ai-notes/initialization/), or a more [math-focused blog post](https://pouannes.github.io/blog/initialization)).
# In case something remains unclear after this tutorial, we recommend skimming through these blog posts as well.
#
# When initializing a neural network, there are a few properties we would like to have.
# First, the variance of the input should be propagated through the model to the last layer, so that we have a similar standard deviation for the output neurons.
# If the variance would vanish the deeper we go in our model, it becomes much harder to optimize the model as the input to the next layer is basically a single constant value.
# Similarly, if the variance increases, it is likely to explode (i.e. head to infinity) the deeper we design our model.
# The second property we look out for in initialization techniques is a gradient distribution with equal variance across layers.
# If the first layer receives much smaller gradients than the last layer, we will have difficulties in choosing an appropriate learning rate.
#
# As a starting point for finding a good method, we will analyze different initialization based on our linear neural network with no activation function (i.e. an identity).
# We do this because initializations depend on the specific activation
# function used in the network, and we can adjust the initialization
# schemes later on for our specific choice.

# %%
model = BaseNetwork(act_fn=Identity()).to(device)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Constant initialization
#
# The first initialization we can consider is to initialize all weights with the same constant value.
# Intuitively, setting all weights to zero is not a good idea as the propagated gradient will be zero.
# However, what happens if we set all weights to a value slightly larger or smaller than 0?
# To find out, we can implement a function for setting all parameters below and visualize the gradients.


# %%
def const_init(model, fill=0.0):
    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        param.data.fill_(fill)


const_init(model, fill=0.005)
visualize_gradients(model)
visualize_activations(model, print_variance=True)

# %% [markdown]
# As we can see, only the first and the last layer have diverse gradient distributions while the other three layers have the same gradient for all weights (note that this value is unequal 0, but often very close to it).
# Having the same gradient for parameters that have been initialized with the same values means that we will always have the same value for those parameters.
# This would make our layer useless and reduce our effective number of parameters to 1.
# Thus, we cannot use a constant initialization to train our networks.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Constant variance
#
# From the experiment above, we have seen that a constant value is not working.
# So instead, how about we initialize the parameters by randomly sampling from a distribution like a Gaussian?
# The most intuitive way would be to choose one variance that is used for all layers in the network.
# Let's implement it below, and visualize the activation distribution across layers.


# %%
def var_init(model, std=0.01):
    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        param.data.normal_(mean=0.0, std=std)


var_init(model, std=0.01)
visualize_activations(model, print_variance=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The variance of the activation becomes smaller and smaller across layers, and almost vanishes in the last layer.
# Alternatively, we could use a higher standard deviation:

# %%
var_init(model, std=0.1)
visualize_activations(model, print_variance=True)

# %% [markdown]
# With a higher standard deviation, the activations are likely to explode.
# You can play around with the specific standard deviation values, but it will be hard to find one that gives us a good activation distribution across layers and is very specific to our model.
# If we would change the hidden sizes or number of layers, you would have
# to search all over again, which is neither efficient nor recommended.

# %% [markdown]
# ### How to find appropriate initialization values
#
# From our experiments above, we have seen that we need to sample the weights from a distribution, but are not sure which one exactly.
# As a next step, we will try to find the optimal initialization from the perspective of the activation distribution.
# For this, we state two requirements:
#
# 1. The mean of the activations should be zero
# 2. The variance of the activations should stay the same across every layer
#
# Suppose we want to design an initialization for the following layer: $y=Wx+b$ with $y\in\mathbb{R}^{d_y}$, $x\in\mathbb{R}^{d_x}$.
# Our goal is that the variance of each element of $y$ is the same as the input, i.e. $\text{Var}(y_i)=\text{Var}(x_i)=\sigma_x^{2}$, and that the mean is zero.
# We assume $x$ to also have a mean of zero, because, in deep neural networks, $y$ would be the input of another layer.
# This requires the bias and weight to have an expectation of 0.
# Actually, as $b$ is a single element per output neuron and is constant across different inputs, we set it to 0 overall.
#
# Next, we need to calculate the variance with which we need to initialize the weight parameters.
# Along the calculation, we will need to following variance rule: given two independent variables, the variance of their product is $\text{Var}(X\cdot Y) = \mathbb{E}(Y)^2\text{Var}(X) + \mathbb{E}(X)^2\text{Var}(Y) + \text{Var}(X)\text{Var}(Y) = \mathbb{E}(Y^2)\mathbb{E}(X^2)-\mathbb{E}(Y)^2\mathbb{E}(X)^2$ ($X$ and $Y$ are not referring to $x$ and $y$, but any random variable).
#
# The needed variance of the weights, $\text{Var}(w_{ij})$, is calculated as follows:
#
# $$
# \begin{split}
#     y_i & = \sum_{j} w_{ij}x_{j}\hspace{10mm}\text{Calculation of a single output neuron without bias}\\
#     \text{Var}(y_i) = \sigma_x^{2} & = \text{Var}\left(\sum_{j} w_{ij}x_{j}\right)\\
#     & = \sum_{j} \text{Var}(w_{ij}x_{j}) \hspace{10mm}\text{Inputs and weights are independent of each other}\\
#     & = \sum_{j} \text{Var}(w_{ij})\cdot\text{Var}(x_{j}) \hspace{10mm}\text{Variance rule (see above) with expectations being zero}\\
#     & = d_x \cdot \text{Var}(w_{ij})\cdot\text{Var}(x_{j}) \hspace{10mm}\text{Variance equal for all $d_x$ elements}\\
#     & = \sigma_x^{2} \cdot d_x \cdot \text{Var}(w_{ij})\\
#     \Rightarrow \text{Var}(w_{ij}) = \sigma_{W}^2 & = \frac{1}{d_x}\\
# \end{split}
# $$
#
# Thus, we should initialize the weight distribution with a variance of the inverse of the input dimension $d_x$.
# Let's implement it below and check whether this holds:


# %%
def equal_var_init(model):
    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        if name.endswith(".bias"):
            param.data.fill_(0)
        else:
            param.data.normal_(std=1.0 / math.sqrt(param.shape[1]))


equal_var_init(model)
visualize_weight_distribution(model)
visualize_activations(model, print_variance=True)

# %% [markdown]
# As we expected, the variance stays indeed constant across layers.
# Note that our initialization does not restrict us to a normal distribution, but allows any other distribution with a mean of 0 and variance of $1/d_x$.
# You often see that a uniform distribution is used for initialization.
# A small benefit of using a uniform instead of a normal distribution is that we can exclude the chance of initializing very large or small weights.
#
# Besides the variance of the activations, another variance we would like to stabilize is the one of the gradients.
# This ensures a stable optimization for deep networks.
# It turns out that we can do the same calculation as above starting from $\Delta x=W\Delta y$, and come to the conclusion that we should initialize our layers with $1/d_y$ where $d_y$ is the number of output neurons.
# You can do the calculation as a practice, or check a thorough explanation in [this blog post](https://pouannes.github.io/blog/initialization).
# As a compromise between both constraints, [Glorot and Bengio (2010)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf?hc_location=ufi) proposed to use the harmonic mean of both values.
# This leads us to the well-known Xavier initialization:
#
# $$W\sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\frac{2}{d_x+d_y}\right)$$
#
# If we use a uniform distribution, we would initialize the weights with:
#
# $$W\sim U\left[-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{d_x+d_y}}, \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{d_x+d_y}}\right]$$
#
# Let's shortly implement it and validate its effectiveness:


# %%
def xavier_init(model):
    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        if name.endswith(".bias"):
            param.data.fill_(0)
        else:
            bound = math.sqrt(6) / math.sqrt(param.shape[0] + param.shape[1])
            param.data.uniform_(-bound, bound)


xavier_init(model)
visualize_gradients(model, print_variance=True)
visualize_activations(model, print_variance=True)

# %% [markdown]
# We see that the Xavier initialization balances the variance of gradients and activations.
# Note that the significantly higher variance for the output layer is due to the large difference of input and output dimension ($128$ vs $10$).
# However, we currently assumed the activation function to be linear.
# So what happens if we add a non-linearity?
# In a tanh-based network, a common assumption is that for small values during the initial steps in training, the $\tanh$ works as a linear function such that we don't have to adjust our calculation.
# We can check if that is the case for us as well:

# %%
model = BaseNetwork(act_fn=nn.Tanh()).to(device)
xavier_init(model)
visualize_gradients(model, print_variance=True)
visualize_activations(model, print_variance=True)

# %% [markdown]
# Although the variance decreases over depth, it is apparent that the activation distribution becomes more focused on the low values.
# Therefore, our variance will stabilize around 0.25 if we would go even deeper.
# Hence, we can conclude that the Xavier initialization works well for Tanh networks.
# But what about ReLU networks?
# Here, we cannot take the previous assumption of the non-linearity becoming linear for small values.
# The ReLU activation function sets (in expectation) half of the inputs to 0 so that also the expectation of the input is not zero.
# However, as long as the expectation of $W$ is zero and $b=0$, the expectation of the output is zero.
# The part where the calculation of the ReLU initialization differs from the identity is when determining $\text{Var}(w_{ij}x_{j})$:
#
# $$\text{Var}(w_{ij}x_{j})=\underbrace{\mathbb{E}[w_{ij}^2]}_{=\text{Var}(w_{ij})}\mathbb{E}[x_{j}^2]-\underbrace{\mathbb{E}[w_{ij}]^2}_{=0}\mathbb{E}[x_{j}]^2=\text{Var}(w_{ij})\mathbb{E}[x_{j}^2]$$
#
# If we assume now that $x$ is the output of a ReLU activation (from a previous layer, $x=max(0,\tilde{y})$), we can calculate the expectation as follows:
#
#
# $$
# \begin{split}
#     \mathbb{E}[x^2] & =\mathbb{E}[\max(0,\tilde{y})^2]\\
#                     & =\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}[{\tilde{y}}^2]\hspace{2cm}\tilde{y}\text{ is zero-centered and symmetric}\\
#                     & =\frac{1}{2}\text{Var}(\tilde{y})
# \end{split}$$
#
# Thus, we see that we have an additional factor of 1/2 in the equation, so that our desired weight variance becomes $2/d_x$.
# This gives us the Kaiming initialization (see [He, K. et al.
# (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852)).
# Note that the Kaiming initialization does not use the harmonic mean between input and output size.
# In their paper (Section 2.2, Backward Propagation, last paragraph), they argue that using $d_x$ or $d_y$ both lead to stable gradients throughout the network, and only depend on the overall input and output size of the network.
# Hence, we can use here only the input $d_x$:

# First, we need to understand what an optimizer actually does.
# The optimizer is responsible to update the network's parameters given the gradients.
# Hence, we effectively implement a function $w^{t} = f(w^{t-1}, g^{t}, ...)$ with $w$ being the parameters, and $g^{t} = \nabla_{w^{(t-1)}} \mathcal{L}^{(t)}$ the gradients at time step $t$.
# A common, additional parameter to this function is the learning rate, here denoted by $\eta$.
# Usually, the learning rate can be seen as the "step size" of the update.
# A higher learning rate means that we change the weights more in the direction of the gradients, a smaller means we take shorter steps.
#
# As most optimizers only differ in the implementation of $f$, we can define a template for an optimizer in PyTorch below.
# We take as input the parameters of a model and a learning rate.
# The function `zero_grad` sets the gradients of all parameters to zero, which we have to do before calling `loss.backward()`.
# Finally, the `step()` function tells the optimizer to update all weights based on their gradients.
# The template is setup below:


# %%
class OptimizerTemplate:
    def __init__(self, params, lr):
        self.params = list(params)
        self.lr = lr

    def zero_grad(self):
        # Set gradients of all parameters to zero

                p.grad.detach_()  # For second-order optimizers important
                p.grad.zero_()

    @torch.no_grad()
    def step(self):
        # Apply update step to all parameters
        for p in self.params:
            if p.grad is None:  # We skip parameters without any gradients
                continue
            self.update_param(p)

    def update_param(self, p):
        # To be implemented in optimizer-specific classes
        raise NotImplementedError


# %% [markdown]
# The first optimizer we are going to implement is the standard Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
# SGD updates the parameters using the following equation:
#
# $$
# \begin{split}
#     w^{(t)} & = w^{(t-1)} - \eta \cdot g^{(t)}
# \end{split}
# $$
#
# As simple as the equation is also our implementation of SGD:

        p_update = -self.lr * p.grad
        p.add_(p_update)  # In-place update => saves memory and does not create computation graph


# %% [markdown]
# In the lecture, we also have discussed the concept of momentum which replaces the gradient in the update by an exponential average of all past gradients including the current one:
#
# $$
# \begin{split}
#     m^{(t)} & = \beta_1 m^{(t-1)} + (1 - \beta_1)\cdot g^{(t)}\\
#     w^{(t)} & = w^{(t-1)} - \eta \cdot m^{(t)}\\
# \end{split}
# $$
#
# Let's also implement it below:


# %%
class SGDMomentum(OptimizerTemplate):
    def __init__(self, params, lr, momentum=0.0):
        super().__init__(params, lr)
        self.momentum = momentum  # Corresponds to beta_1 in the equation above

        self.param_momentum[p] = (1 - self.momentum) * p.grad + self.momentum * self.param_momentum[p]
        p_update = -self.lr * self.param_momentum[p]
        p.add_(p_update)


# %% [markdown]
# Finally, we arrive at Adam.
# Adam combines the idea of momentum with an adaptive learning rate, which is based on an exponential average of the squared gradients, i.e. the gradients norm.
# Furthermore, we add a bias correction for the momentum and adaptive learning rate for the first iterations:
#
# $$
# \begin{split}
#     m^{(t)} & = \beta_1 m^{(t-1)} + (1 - \beta_1)\cdot g^{(t)}\\
#     v^{(t)} & = \beta_2 v^{(t-1)} + (1 - \beta_2)\cdot \left(g^{(t)}\right)^2\\
#     \hat{m}^{(t)} & = \frac{m^{(t)}}{1-\beta^{t}_1}, \hat{v}^{(t)} = \frac{v^{(t)}}{1-\beta^{t}_2}\\
#     w^{(t)} & = w^{(t-1)} - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{v^{(t)}} + \epsilon}\circ \hat{m}^{(t)}\\
# \end{split}
# $$
#
# Epsilon is a small constant used to improve numerical stability for very small gradient norms.
# Remember that the adaptive learning rate does not replace the learning
# rate hyperparameter $\eta$, but rather acts as an extra factor and
# ensures that the gradients of various parameters have a similar norm.

# ### Comparing optimizers on model training
#
# After we have implemented three optimizers (SGD, SGD with momentum, and Adam), we can start to analyze and compare them.
# First, we test them on how well they can optimize a neural network on the FashionMNIST dataset.
# We use again our linear network, this time with a ReLU activation and the kaiming initialization, which we have found before to work well for ReLU-based networks.
# Note that the model is over-parameterized for this task, and we can achieve similar performance with a much smaller network (for example `100,100,100`).
# However, our main interest is in how well the optimizer can train *deep*
# neural networks, hence the over-parameterization.

# %%
base_model = BaseNetwork(act_fn=nn.ReLU(), hidden_sizes=[512, 256, 256, 128])

# For a fair comparison, we train the exact same model with the same seed with the three optimizers below.
# Feel free to change the hyperparameters if you want (however, you have to train your own model then).

# %% [markdown]
# The result is that all optimizers perform similarly well with the given model.
# The differences are too small to find any significant conclusion.
# However, keep in mind that this can also be attributed to the initialization we chose.
# When changing the initialization to worse (e.g. constant initialization), Adam usually shows to be more robust because of its adaptive learning rate.
# To show the specific benefits of the optimizers, we will continue to
# look at some possible loss surfaces in which momentum and adaptive
# learning rate are crucial.

# ### Pathological curvatures
#
# A pathological curvature is a type of surface that is similar to ravines and is particularly tricky for plain SGD optimization.
# In words, pathological curvatures typically have a steep gradient in one direction with an optimum at the center, while in a second direction we have a slower gradient towards a (global) optimum.
# Let's first create an example surface of this and visualize it:

# In terms of optimization, you can image that $w_1$ and $w_2$ are weight parameters, and the curvature represents the loss surface over the space of $w_1$ and $w_2$.
# Note that in typical networks, we have many, many more parameters than two, and such curvatures can occur in multi-dimensional spaces as well.
#
# Ideally, our optimization algorithm would find the center of the ravine and focuses on optimizing the parameters towards the direction of $w_2$.
# However, if we encounter a point along the ridges, the gradient is much greater in $w_1$ than $w_2$, and we might end up jumping from one side to the other.
# Due to the large gradients, we would have to reduce our learning rate slowing down learning significantly.
#
# To test our algorithms, we can implement a simple function to train two parameters on such a surface:

# Most of the loss surface has very little to no gradients.
# However, close to the optima, we have very steep gradients.
# To reach the minimum when starting in a region with lower gradients, we expect an adaptive learning rate to be crucial.
# To verify this hypothesis, we can run our three optimizers on the surface:

# SGD first takes very small steps until it touches the border of the optimum.
# First reaching a point around $(-0.75,-0.5)$, the gradient direction has changed and pushes the parameters to $(0.8,0.5)$ from which SGD cannot recover anymore (only with many, many steps).
# A similar problem has SGD with momentum, only that it continues the direction of the touch of the optimum.
# The gradients from this time step are so much larger than any other point that the momentum $m_t$ is overpowered by it.
# Finally, Adam is able to converge in the optimum showing the importance of adaptive learning rates.

# ### What optimizer to take
#
# After seeing the results on optimization, what is our conclusion?
# Should we always use Adam and never look at SGD anymore?
# The short answer: no.
# There are many papers saying that in certain situations, SGD (with momentum) generalizes better where Adam often tends to overfit [5,6].
# This is related to the idea of finding wider optima.
# For instance, see the illustration of different optima below (credit: [Keskar et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04836)):

# The black line represents the training loss surface, while the dotted red line is the test loss.
# Finding sharp, narrow minima can be helpful for finding the minimal training loss.
# However, this doesn't mean that it also minimizes the test loss as especially flat minima have shown to generalize better.
# You can imagine that the test dataset has a slightly shifted loss surface due to the different examples than in the training set.
# A small change can have a significant influence for sharp minima, while flat minima are generally more robust to this change.
#
# In the next tutorial, we will see that some network types can still be better optimized with SGD and learning rate scheduling than Adam.
# Nevertheless, Adam is the most commonly used optimizer in Deep Learning
# as it usually performs better than other optimizers, especially for deep
# networks.

# ## Conclusion
#
# In this tutorial, we have looked at initialization and optimization techniques for neural networks.
# We have seen that a good initialization has to balance the preservation of the gradient variance as well as the activation variance.
# This can be achieved with the Xavier initialization for tanh-based networks, and the Kaiming initialization for ReLU-based networks.
# In optimization, concepts like momentum and adaptive learning rate can help with challenging loss surfaces but don't guarantee an increase in performance for neural networks.
