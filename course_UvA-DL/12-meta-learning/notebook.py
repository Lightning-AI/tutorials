# Meta-Learning offers solutions to these situations, and we will discuss three popular algorithms: __Prototypical Networks__ ([Snell et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175)), __Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning / MAML__ ([Finn et al., 2017](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/finn17a.html)), and __Proto-MAML__ ([Triantafillou et al., 2020](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkgAGAVKPr)).
# We will focus on the task of few-shot classification where the training and test set have distinct sets of classes.
# For instance, we would train the model on the binary classifications of cats-birds and flowers-bikes, but during test time, the model would need to learn from 4 examples each the difference between dogs and otters, two classes we have not seen during training (Figure credit - [Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/11/30/meta-learning.html)).

#
# A different setup, which is very common in Reinforcement Learning and recently Natural Language Processing, is to aim at few-shot learning of a completely new task.
# For example, an robot agent that learned to run, jump and pick up boxes, should quickly adapt to collecting and stacking boxes.
# In NLP, we can think of a model which was trained sentiment classification, hatespeech detection and sarcasm classification, to adapt to classifying the emotion of a text.
# All methods we will discuss in this notebook can be easily applied to these settings since we only use a different definition of a 'task'.
# For few-shot classification, we consider a task to distinguish between $M$ novel classes.
# Here, we would not only have novel classes, but also a completely different dataset.
#
# First of all, let's start with importing our standard libraries. We will again be using PyTorch Lightning.

# ## Few-shot classification

# We start our implementation by discussing the dataset setup.
# In this notebook, we will use CIFAR100 which we have already seen in Tutorial 6.
# CIFAR100 has 100 classes each with 600 images of size $32\times 32$ pixels.
# Instead of splitting the training, validation and test set over examples, we will split them over classes: we will use 80 classes for training, and 10 for validation and 10 for testing.

# ### Data sampling
#
# The strategy of how to use the available training data for learning few-shot adaptation is crucial in meta-learning.
# All three algorithms that we discuss here have a similar idea: simulate few-shot learning during training.
# Specifically, at each training step, we randomly select a small number of classes, and sample a small number of examples for each class.
# This represents our few-shot training batch, which we also refer to as **support set**.
# Additionally, we sample a second set of examples from the same classes, and refer to this batch as **query set**.
# Our training objective is to classify the query set correctly from seeing the support set and its corresponding labels.
# The main difference between our three methods (ProtoNet, MAML, and Proto-MAML) is in how they use the support set to adapt to the training classes.
#
# This subsection summarizes the code that is needed to create such training batches.
# In PyTorch, we can specify the data sampling procedure by so-called `Sampler` ([documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#data-loading-order-and-sampler)).
# Samplers are iterable objects that return indices in the order in which the data elements should be sampled.
# In our previous notebooks, we usually used the option `shuffle=True` in the `data.DataLoader` objects which creates a sampler returning the data indices in a random order.
# Here, we focus on samplers that return batches of indices that correspond to support and query set batches.
# Below, we implement such a sampler.

# %% [markdown]
# The Prototypical Network, or ProtoNet for short, is a metric-based meta-learning algorithm which operates similar to a nearest neighbor classification.
# Metric-based meta-learning methods classify a new example $\mathbf{x}$ based on some distance function $d_{\varphi}$ between $x$ and all elements in the support set.
# ProtoNets implements this idea with the concept of prototypes in a learned feature space.
# First, ProtoNet uses an embedding function $f_{\theta}$ to encode each input in the support set into a $L$-dimensional feature vector.
# Next, for each class $c$, we collect the feature vectors of all examples with label $c$, and average their feature vectors.
# Formally, we can define this as:
#
# $$\mathbf{v}_c=\frac{1}{|S_c|}\sum_{(\mathbf{x}_i,y_i)\in S_c}f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_i)$$
#
# where $S_c$ is the part of the support set $S$ for which $y_i=c$, and $\mathbf{v}_c$ represents the _prototype_ of class $c$.
# The prototype calculation is visualized below for a 2-dimensional feature space and 3 classes (Figure credit - [Snell et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175)).
# The colored dots represent encoded support elements with color-corresponding class label, and the black dots next to the class label are the averaged prototypes.
#
# <center width="100%"><img src="protonet_classification.svg" width="300px"></center>
#
# Based on these prototypes, we want to classify a new example.
# Remember that since we want to learn the encoding function $f_{\theta}$, this classification must be differentiable and hence, we need to define a probability distribution across classes.
# For this, we will make use of the distance function $d_{\varphi}$: the closer a new example $\mathbf{x}$ is to a prototype $\mathbf{v}_c$, the higher the probability for $\mathbf{x}$ belonging to class $c$.
# Formally, we can simply use a softmax over the distances of $\mathbf{x}$ to all class prototypes:
#
# $$p(y=c\vert\mathbf{x})=\text{softmax}(-d_{\varphi}(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{v}_c))=\frac{\exp\left(-d_{\varphi}(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{v}_c)\right)}{\sum_{c'\in \mathcal{C}}\exp\left(-d_{\varphi}(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{v}_{c'})\right)}$$
#
# Note that the negative sign is necessary since we want to increase the probability for close-by vectors and have a low probability for distant vectors.
# We train the network $f_{\theta}$ based on the cross entropy error of the training query set examples.
# Thereby, the gradient flows through both the prototypes $\mathbf{v}_c$ and the query set encodings $f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})$.
# For the distance function $d_{\varphi}$, we can choose any function as long as it is differentiable with respect to both of its inputs.
# The most common function, which we also use here, is the squared
# euclidean distance, but there has been several works on different
# distance functions as well.

# ### ProtoNet implementation

# %% [markdown]
# Now that we know how a ProtoNet works in principle, let's look at how we can apply to our specific problem of few-shot image classification, and implement it below.
# First, we need to define the encoder function $f_{\theta}$.
# Since we work with CIFAR images, we can take a look back at Tutorial 5 where we compared common Computer Vision architectures, and choose one of the best performing ones.
# Here, we go with a DenseNet since it is in general more parameter efficient than ResNet.
# Luckily, we do not need to implement DenseNet ourselves again and can rely on torchvision's model package instead.
# We use common hyperparameters of 64 initial feature channels, add 32 per block, and use a bottleneck size of 64 (i.e. 2 times the growth rate).
# We use 4 stages of 6 layers each, which results in overall about 1 million parameters.
# Note that the torchvision package assumes that the last layer is used for classification and hence calls its output size `num_classes`.
# However, we can instead just use it as the feature space of ProtoNet, and choose an arbitrary dimensionality.
# We will use the same network for other algorithms in this notebook to ensure a fair comparison.


# %%
def get_convnet(output_size):
    convnet = torchvision.models.DenseNet(
        growth_rate=32,
        block_config=(6, 6, 6, 6),
        bn_size=2,
        num_init_features=64,
        num_classes=output_size,  # Output dimensionality
    )
    return convnet


# %% [markdown]
# Next, we can look at implementing ProtoNet.
# We will define it as PyTorch Lightning module to use all functionalities of PyTorch Lightning.
# The first step during training is to encode all images in a batch with our network.
# Next, we calculate the class prototypes from the support set (function `calculate_prototypes`), and classify the query set examples according to the prototypes (function `classify_feats`).

# In contrast to standard supervised learning, we see that ProtoNet does not overfit as much as we would expect.
# The validation accuracy is of course lower than the average training, but the training loss does not stick close to zero.

# ### Testing
#
# Our goal of meta-learning is to obtain a model that can quickly adapt to a new task, or in this case, new classes to distinguish between.
# To test this, we will use our trained ProtoNet and adapt it to the 10 test classes.
# Thereby, we pick $k$ examples per class from which we determine the prototypes, and test the classification accuracy on all other examples.
# This can be seen as using the $k$ examples per class as support set, and the rest of the dataset as a query set.
# We iterate through the dataset such that each example has been once included in a support set.
# The average performance over all support sets tells us how well we can expect ProtoNet to perform when seeing only $k$ examples per class.
# During training, we used $k=4$.
# In testing, we will experiment with $k=\{2,4,8,16,32\}$ to get a better sense of how $k$ influences the results.
# We would expect that we achieve higher accuracies the more examples we have in the support set, but we don't know how it scales.
# Hence, let's first implement a function that executes the testing procedure for a given $k$:

# As we initially expected, the performance of ProtoNet indeed increases the more samples we have.
# However, even with just two samples per class, we classify almost half of the images correctly, which is well above random accuracy (10%).
# The curve shows an exponentially dampend trend, meaning that adding 2 extra examples to $k=2$ has a much higher impact than adding 2 extra samples if we already have $k=16$.
# Nonetheless, we can say that ProtoNet adapts fairly well to new classes.

# The second meta-learning algorithm we will look at is MAML, short for Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning.
# MAML is an optimization-based meta-learning algorithm, which means that it tries to adjust the standard optimization procedure to a few-shot setting.
# The idea of MAML is relatively simple: given a model, support and query set during training, we optimize the model for $m$ steps on the support set, and evaluate the gradients of the query loss with respect to the original model's parameters.
# For the same model, we do it for a few different support-query sets and accumulate the gradients.
# This results in learning a model that provides a good initialization for being quickly adapted to the training tasks.
# If we denote the model parameters with $\theta$, we can visualize the procedure as follows (Figure credit - [Finn et al. ](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/finn17a.html)).
#
# <center width="100%"><img src="MAML_figure.svg" width="300px"></center>

# %% [markdown]
# The full algorithm of MAML is therefore as follows.
# At each training step, we sample a batch of tasks, i.e., a batch of support-query set pairs.
# For each task $\mathcal{T}_i$, we optimize a model $f_{\theta}$ on the support set via SGD, and denote this model as $f_{\theta_i'}$.
# We refer to this optimization as _inner loop_.
# Using this new model, we calculate the gradients of the original parameters, $\theta$, with respect to the query loss on $f_{\theta_i'}$.
# These gradients are accumulated over all tasks, and used to update $\theta$.
# This is called _outer loop_ since we iterate over tasks.
# The full MAML algorithm is summarized below (Figure credit - [Finn et al. ](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/finn17a.html)).
#
# <center width="100%"><img src="MAML_algorithm.svg" width="400px"></center>

# %% [markdown]
# To obtain gradients for the initial parameters $\theta$ from the optimized model $f_{\theta_i'}$, we actually need second-order gradients, i.e. gradients of gradients, as the support set gradients depend on $\theta$ as well.
# This makes MAML computationally expensive, especially when using multiple inner loop steps.
# A simpler, yet almost equally well performing alternative is First-Order MAML (FOMAML) which only uses first-order gradients.
# This means that the second-order gradients are ignored, and we can calculate the outer loop gradients (line 10 in algorithm 2) simply by calculating the gradients with respect to $\theta_i'$, and use those as update to $\theta$.
# Hence, the new update rule becomes:
# $$\theta\leftarrow\theta-\beta\sum_{\mathcal{T}_i\sim p(\mathcal{T})}\nabla_{\theta_i'}\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_i}(f_{\theta_i'})$$
# Note the change of $\theta$ to $\theta_i'$ for $\nabla$.

# %% [markdown]
# ### ProtoMAML
#
# A problem of MAML is how to design the output classification layer.
# In case all tasks have different number of classes, we need to initialize the output layer with zeros or randomly in every iteration.
# Even if we always have the same number of classes, we just start from random predictions.
# This requires several inner loop steps to reach a reasonable classification result.
# To overcome this problem, Triantafillou et al.
# (2020) propose to combine the merits of Prototypical Networks and MAML.
# Specifically, we can use prototypes to initialize our output layer to have a strong initialization.
# Thereby, it can be shown that the softmax over euclidean distances can be reformulated as a linear layer with softmax.
# To see this, let's first write out the negative euclidean distance between a feature vector $f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{*})$ of a new data point $\mathbf{x}^{*}$ to a prototype $\mathbf{v}_c$ of class $c$:
# $$
# -||f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{*})-\mathbf{v}_c||^2=-f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{*})^Tf_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{*})+2\mathbf{v}_c^{T}f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{*})-\mathbf{v}_c^T\mathbf{v}_c
# $$
#
# We perform the classification across all classes $c\in\mathcal{C}$ and take a softmax on the distance.
# Hence, any term that is same for all classes can be removed without changing the output probabilities.
# In the equation above, this is true for $-f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{*})^Tf_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{*})$ since it is independent of any class prototype.
# Thus, we can write:
#
# $$
# -||f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{*})-\mathbf{v}_c||^2=2\mathbf{v}_c^{T}f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{*})-||\mathbf{v}_c||^2+\text{constant}
# $$
#
# Taking a second look at the equation above, it looks a lot like a linear layer.
# For this, we use $\mathbf{W}_{c,\cdot}=2\mathbf{v}_c$ and $b_c=-||\mathbf{v}_c||^2$ which gives us the linear layer $\mathbf{W}f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}^{*})+\mathbf{b}$.
# Hence, if we initialize the output weight with twice the prototypes, and the biases by the negative squared L2 norm of the prototypes, we start with a Prototypical Network.
# MAML allows us to adapt this layer and the rest of the network further.
#
# In the following, we will implement First-Order ProtoMAML for few-shot classification.
# The implementation of MAML would be the same except the output layer initialization.

# %% [markdown]
# ### ProtoMAML implementation
#
# For implementing ProtoMAML, we can follow Algorithm 2 with minor modifications.
# At each training step, we first sample a batch of tasks, and a support and query set for each task.
# In our case of few-shot classification, this means that we simply sample multiple support-query set pairs from our sampler.
# For each task, we finetune our current model on the support set.
# However, since we need to remember the original parameters for the other tasks, the outer loop gradient update and future training steps, we need to create a copy of our model, and finetune only the copy.
# We can copy a model by using standard Python functions like `deepcopy`.
# The inner loop is implemented in the function `adapt_few_shot` in the PyTorch Lightning module below.
#
# After finetuning the model, we apply it on the query set and calculate the first-order gradients with respect to the original parameters $\theta$.
# In contrast to simple MAML, we also have to consider the gradients with respect to the output layer initialization, i.e. the prototypes, since they directly rely on $\theta$.
# To realize this efficiently, we take two steps.
# First, we calculate the prototypes by applying the original model, i.e. not the copied model, on the support elements.
# When initializing the output layer, we detach the prototypes to stop the gradients.
# This is because in the inner loop itself, we do not want to consider gradients through the prototypes back to the original model.
# However, after the inner loop is finished, we re-attach the computation graph of the prototypes by writing `output_weight = (output_weight - init_weight).detach() + init_weight`.
# While this line does not change the value of the variable `output_weight`, it adds its dependency on the prototype initialization `init_weight`.
# Thus, if we call `.backward` on `output_weight`, we will automatically calculate the first-order gradients with respect to the prototype initialization in the original model.
#
# After calculating all gradients and summing them together in the original model, we can take a standard optimizer step.
# PyTorch Lightning's method is however designed to return a loss-tensor on which we call `.backward` first.
# Since this is not possible here, we need to perform the optimization step ourselves.
# All details can be found in the code below.
#
# For implementing (Proto-)MAML with second-order gradients, it is recommended to use libraries such as [$\nabla$higher](https://github.com/facebookresearch/higher) from Facebook AI Research.
# For simplicity, we stick with first-order methods here.

# ### Training
#
# To train ProtoMAML, we need to change our sampling slightly.
# Instead of a single support-query set batch, we need to sample multiple.
# To implement this, we yet use another Sampler which combines multiple batches from a `FewShotBatchSampler`, and returns it afterwards.
# Additionally, we define a `collate_fn` for our data loader which takes the stack of support-query set images, and returns the tasks as a list.
# This makes it easier to process in our PyTorch Lightning module before.
# The implementation of the sampler can be found below.

# We use the same feature space size as for ProtoNet, but can use a higher learning rate since the outer loop gradients are accumulated over 16 batches.

# However, for our setup, we observed no noticeable impact of using a different learning rate than the base model.
# The number of inner loop updates is another crucial hyperparmaeter, and depends on the similarity of our training tasks.
# Since all tasks are on images from the same dataset, we notice that a single inner loop update achieves similar performance as 3 or 5 while training considerably faster.
# However, especially in RL and NLP, larger number of inner loop steps are often needed.

# One obvious difference to ProtoNet is that the loss curves look much less noisy.
# This is because we average the outer loop gradients over multiple tasks, and thus have a smoother training curve.
# Additionally, we only have 15k training iterations after 200 epochs.
# This is again because of the task batches, which cause 16 times less iterations.
# However, each iteration has seen 16 times more data in this experiment.
# Thus, we still have a fair comparison between ProtoMAML and ProtoNet.

# This is why this process is more expensive than ProtoNet, and in our case, testing $k=\{2,4,8,16,32\}$ can take almost an hour.
# Hence, we provide evaluation files besides the pretrained models.

# We can observe that ProtoMAML is indeed able to outperform ProtoNet for $k>4$.
# This is because with more samples, it becomes more relevant to also adapt the base model's parameters.
# Meanwhile, for $k=2$, ProtoMAML achieves lower performance than ProtoNet.
# This is likely also related to choosing 200 inner loop updates since with more updates, there exists the risk of overfitting.
# Nonetheless, the high standard deviation for $k=2$ makes it hard to take any statistically valid conclusion.
#
# Overall, we can conclude that ProtoMAML slightly outperforms ProtoNet for larger shot counts.
# However, one disadvantage of ProtoMAML is its much longer training and testing time.

# ProtoMAML, and might be the better solution in situations where limited

# So, what happens if we apply them on a quite different dataset than CIFAR?
# This is what we try out below, and evaluate ProtoNet and ProtoMAML on the SVHN dataset.

# %% [markdown]
# ### SVHN dataset
#
# The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset is a real-world image dataset for house number detection.
# It is similar to MNIST by having the classes 0 to 9, but is more difficult due to its real-world setting and possible distracting numbers left and right.
# Let's first load the dataset, and visualize some images to get an impression of the dataset.

# Each image is labeled with one class between 0 and 9 representing the main digit in the image.
# Can our ProtoNet and ProtoMAML learn to classify the digits from only a few examples?
# This is what we will test out below.
# The images have the same size as CIFAR, so that we can use the images without changes.
# We first prepare the dataset, for which we take the first 500 images per class.
# For this dataset, we use our test functions as before to get an estimated performance for different number of shots.

# ### Experiments
#
# First, we can apply ProtoNet to the SVHN dataset:

    )

# %% [markdown]
# It becomes clear that the results are much lower than the ones on CIFAR, and just slightly above random for $k=2$.
# How about ProtoMAML?
# We provide again evaluation files since the evaluation can take several minutes to complete.

# %%

    )

# %% [markdown]
# While ProtoMAML shows similar performance than ProtoNet for $k\leq 4$, it considerably outperforms ProtoNet for more than 8 shots.
# This is because we can adapt the base model, which is crucial when the data does not fit the original training data.
# For $k=32$, ProtoMAML achieves $13\%$ higher classification accuracy than ProtoNet which already starts to flatten out.
# We can see the trend more clearly in our plot below.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Conclusion
#
# In this notebook, we have discussed meta-learning algorithms that learn to adapt to new classes and/or tasks with just a few samples.
# We have discussed three popular algorithms, namely ProtoNet, MAML and ProtoMAML.
# On the few-shot image classification task of CIFAR100, ProtoNet and ProtoMAML showed to perform similarly well, with slight benefits of ProtoMAML for larger shot sizes.
# However, for out-of-distribution data (SVHN), the ability to optimize the base model showed to be crucial and gave ProtoMAML considerable performance gains over ProtoNet.
# Nonetheless, ProtoNet offers other advantages compared to ProtoMAML, namely a very cheap training and test cost as well as a simpler implementation.
# Hence, it is recommended to consider whether the additionally complexity
# of ProtoMAML is worth the extra training computation cost, or whether
# ProtoNet is already sufficient for the task at hand.
